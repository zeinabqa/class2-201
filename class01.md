Introductory HTML and JavaScriptStructure:

Structure is from the Latin word structura which means "a fitting together, building." Although it's certainly used to describe buildings, it can do more than that. A family's
structure includes the relationship of its members, your body structure can refer to how your muscles and bones fit together. Sentence structure is how a sentence is put
together, including subjects, verbs, and all that stuff English teachers love to yap about. Structure is usually a noun, but it can also be a verb meaning to impose order,
like if you "structure an argument to convince your parents to let you stay out later."
Like a newspaper HTML structure pages by using elements. As it uses attributes to tell us More about elements.

Extra Markup:
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. (HTML4, XHTML1.0, HTML5)

Doc Type: Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using 
(although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book.
.Comments ON HTML:
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser, you can add the text between these characters.

ID Attribute: Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter 
or an underscore (not a number or any other character). No two elements on the same page must have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer 
unique).
Class Attribute: Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify 
several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your site and links that point to external sites.
HTML5 layout:
HTML Layout Elements:-
- Defines a header for a document or a section
- Defines a set of navigation links
- Defines a section in a document
- Defines an independent, self-contained content
- Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- Defines a footer for a document or a section

- Defines a heading for the

HTML5 Layout Elements:-
While the traditional HTML uses ‘div’ element to group related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer, or sidebar).

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.

Headers & Footers the ‘header’ element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The element contains ‘footer’ copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy.

The element is used to ‘nav’ contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

The element acts as ‘article’ a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. The elements can ‘article’ even be nested inside each other.

The element ‘aside’ has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.

When the element ‘aside’ is used inside an ‘article’ element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.

When the element is ‘aside’ used outside of an ‘article’ element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

The element groups ‘section’ related content together, and typically each section would have its heading.

Process and Design:
Process Design is the act of transforming an organization’s vision, goals, and available resources into a discernible, measureable means of achieving the organization’s vision.
Process design may start with process analysis; best practices from similar organizations; process reference models from industry‐standards organizations (e.g., SCOR or eTOM) or third party consultants; or “green field” — ideas coupled with the experience and insights of the process design team. Process design focuses on defining what the organization will do to achieve its financial and other goals.
It’s important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

JavaScript:
A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically. To approach writing a script,
break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
