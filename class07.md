# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

**Define a constructor and initialize properties**

o define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.

This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

Generate random numbers
avaScript standard library includes **a Math.random()** function for just this sort of occasion.

# Tables 
A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.

By default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned.

**Spanning ColumnS** 
Sometimes you may need the
entries in a table to stretch
across more than one column.
The colspan attribute can be
used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element
and indicates how many columns
that cell should run across.

* The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the `<tr>` element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.


# Object Literals
**Objects** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
**property**. *Properties te ll us about the object*, such as
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
Each individual hotel might have a different name
and a different number of rooms.


**IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES**

**IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS**

Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
**name and a value.** In an object,
that **name is called a key**.



**Accessing Object Properties**

 You can access object properties in two ways:

1. using dot `objectName.propertyName`
2. using  square bracket  `objectName["propertyName"]`

**The this Keyword**

In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

## Document Object Model
The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements

THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called**a DOM tree**, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes.


* ATTRIBUTE NODES

  The opening tags of HTML elements can carry
attributes and these are represented by attribute
nodes in the DOM tree.

* TEXT NODES
 Once you have accessed an element node, you
can then reach the text within that element. This is
stored in its own text node.

**WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE**

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:

1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

STEP 1: ACCESS THE ELEMENTS

Here are three common ways to
select an individual element:

1. getElementByld ()
2. querySe1ector ()  Uses a CSS selector, and returns the first matching element.

3. You can also select individual
elements by **traversing from one element to another within the DOM tree**

**SELECT MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (NODELISTS)**

1. getElementsByClassName()
2. getElementsByTagName()
3. querySelectorAll() *Uses a CSS selector to select all matching elements.*


**TRAVERSING BETWEEN ELEMENT NODES**

You can move from one element
node to a related element node.
1. **parentNode** Selects the parent of the current
element node (which will return
just one element).
2. previousSibling / nextSibling
3. firstChild / lastChild


**STEP 2: WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS**
1. ACCESS/ UPDATE
TEXT NODES
2. WORK WITH HTML
CONTENT
3. ACCESS OR UPDATE
ATTRIBUTE VALUES
