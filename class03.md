# Lists

*we have three type of list*

1. Numbered lists.
2. Bullet lists
3. 
4. Definition list There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:

### Ordered lists :

*The ordered list is created with the ol element.mEach item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing li tag.*

### Unordered lists:

*The unordered list is created with the ul element.,mEach item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing li tag.*

### Definition lists:

*The definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.*

### Nested Lists:

*You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sublist or nested list.*

# Box Dimensions

*By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties*

### Limiting Width

*min-width, max-width*

### Limiting Height

*min-height, max-height*

### Overflowing Content

## The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:

1. hidden
2. scroll
## Border, Margin & Padding

1. border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

2. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

3. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

### Border Width

*thin medium thick*

### Border Style

*solid dotted dashed double groove inset outset hidden / none and you can color it*

## Hiding Boxes

*visibility has tow attribute hidden visible*

# ARRAYS

*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array). The values are assigned to the 
array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string
, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.
example var colors; colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];*

### VALU ES IN ARRAYS

*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).*

## SWITCH STATEMENTS If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect.

*it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error. A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.*

### TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING

*If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error.*

### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE

*Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for the existence of an element within a page.*

# loops

### USING FOR LOOPS

*A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. In this example, the scores for each round of a test are stored in an array called scores.*

### USING do WHILE LOOPS

*The key difference between a while loop and a do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run 
once whether or not the condition is met.*
